/**
 * An interface defining the contract for time estimation implementations.
 * Estimators track work progress and provide estimates for remaining time
 * based on elapsed time and completed work units.
 *
 * <p>Implementations can be optimized for specific types of work patterns
 * or estimation requirements. The interface provides methods for managing
 * the estimation lifecycle, tracking progress, and retrieving time information.</p>
 *
 * <p>Example usage:</p>
 * <pre>
 * {@literal
 * Estimator<MyEstimator, MyStopwatch> estimator = new MyEstimator();
 * estimator.initAndStart(100); // Initialize with 100 work units
 * estimator.completeWorkUnits(25); // Complete 25 units
 * Duration remainingTime = estimator.getRemainingTime();
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * @param <EstimatorType> The specific type of estimator implementing this interface
 * @param <StopwatchType> The type of stopwatch used for time tracking
